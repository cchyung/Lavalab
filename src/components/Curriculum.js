        <p> Founded in 2013, <b>LAVALAB</b> is <b>USC's premier product incubator</b>. Every semester, Lavalab
        admits a cohort of approximately 25 students from USCâ€™s top talent in engineering, business, and design.
        Each cohort goes through a <b>comprehensive and iterative curriculum</b> on developing a product, 
        accompanied by <b>informative fireside chats</b> with industry leaders, including the likes of Elon Musk,
        Nathan Patterson, and Arielle Zuckerburg. The 8-week program culminates in <b>Demo Night</b>, a
        professional showcase of entirely student-created products, judged by experienced industry figures.
